                  Life, however, is much more than just lines of code and algorithms. When I'm not debugging or designing software solutions, I'm all about enjoying quality time with my friends. 
                  Whether it's engaging in a friendly game of basketball, kicking a football around, or passionately following the Bar√ßa matches, sports play a significant role in my life. 
                  There's something truly special about the camaraderie and excitement of team sports.

                  But that's not all. I'm also a fervent Formula One enthusiast. 
                  The thrill of the race, the engineering marvels behind the cars, and the sheer speed of it all captivate my imagination. 
                  Watching F1 races is more than just a hobby; it's a way to stay connected with the world of technology and innovation, which perfectly complements my chosen career path.
